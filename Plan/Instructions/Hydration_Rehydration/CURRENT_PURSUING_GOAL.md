# Current Pursuing Goal

## Active Wave
Wave 61 workflow lane selection.

## Goal Statement
Select the lowest-risk ComfyUI workflow lane from the runtime requirement templates and verify model/node prerequisites before attempting a bounded first execution.

## Why This Goal Is Active
EC2 runtime inventory passed. The remote ComfyUI runtime, GPU, model folders, custom nodes, synced project checkout, and seven runtime requirement templates are present. The next safe step is matching a workflow lane to available assets before running generation.

## Current Status
SELECTED_AUTHORED_STATIC_SMOKE_IMAGE_QA_AUTH_GATE_PULLBACK_PROFILE_AWARE_LANE_READINESS_EC2_STATIC_PROOF_GATE_SMOKE_COORDINATOR_CURRENT_HELPER_INDEX_AWS_PROFILE_ITEMS_TRACKER_AUTH_RECHECK_PULLBACK_MANIFEST_AUTH_CONTRACT_AND_READINESS_CONTRACT_VALIDATIONS_PASS_PENDING_BROWSER_LOGIN

## Last Action
Hardened selected-lane readiness evidence to include top-level `result` and `failure_category` fields plus auth-gate summary fields, reran auth/profile/readiness gates without starting EC2, passed operations helper validation with both auth and readiness evidence contract checks, and refreshed generated indexes after a corrected index-validation retest.

## Next Action
Complete AWS browser/SSO login externally, rerun `Test-AwsAuthGate.ps1` or `Test-AwsProfileAuthMatrix.ps1` until account `029530099913` is verified and `ec2_work_allowed=true`, rerun `Test-LaneRuntimeReadiness.ps1`, run `Invoke-EC2LaneStaticProof.ps1 -Execute` for object-info/path/hash, then run `Invoke-EC2WorkflowSmokeRun.ps1 -Execute` to own the bounded generation, manifest, pullback, and stop-verification path. After local artifact pullback, run `New-ImageArtifactQARecord.ps1` on the real image and complete visual review.
